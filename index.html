    <h1>My name is Noelle Rousseau</h1>
    <p>I am a graphic designer and am going back to school at Wake Tech for web development. I work full-time and go to school full-time, so I'm quite busy. I still make time for fun though! In my free time I like to play play pinball, work in the yard, cook, travel, be creative, and see movies. Hopefully, with my existing graphic design skills and new web development skills I can make some killer websites in the future!</p>
